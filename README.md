# Conway's Game of Life
A fun little project to practice ES6 and vanilla JS DOM manipulation

[Read about the origins of this game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

## Rules:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
